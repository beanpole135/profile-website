### Basic History
 - (2006) Took my first computer programming class at university (C++ class - required for physics major).
 - (2007) Learned more practical programming skill at the Air Force Institute of Technology (student internship)
 - (2008) Started graduate work at Ohio UniversityDid extensive numerical modeling work for the next 2-3 years in Fortran while at graduate school (trying to model the collapse of a neutron star into a type-II supernova).
 - (2009) Started working part-time with FreeBSD via the PC-BSD project (testing/fixing application packages called PBI's).
 - (2011) Obtained Master of Science degree in Nuclear Astrophysics from Ohio University
 - (2011) Got hired by [iXsystems](https://www.ixsystems.com) full-time as part of the PC-BSD project. 
 - (Current) Still working for [iXsystems](https://www.ixsystems.com) as a software engineer and project lead.

## Computer Skills
| Language | Read | Write | Last Used | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Go | Yes | Yes | Current | Use this for automation, websites, and distributed system meshes.|
| C++ | Yes | Yes | Current | Use this with the Qt libraries primarily|
| Shell | Yes | Yes | Current | Use this all the time on FreeBSD and for writing automation procedures|
| HTML | Yes | Yes | Current | Use this off and on to make changes to websites such as this one|
| C | Yes | Yes | Off and on | Most base-level tools in FreeBSD are written in C and need occasional tweaks.|
| Javascript | Yes | Somewhat | Off and on | Even smaller subset of my HTML skill set. Tend to find it unreliable and less precise than languages like C/C++|
| QML | Yes | Somewhat | 2017 | Slight variation of Javascript for embedded Qt applications|
| Fortran | Yes | Yes | 2011 | Mostly numerical calculations and analysis with advanced mathematics.|
| MATLAB | Yes | Yes | 2008 | Wrote graphical atmospheric modeling software in MATLAB|

#### Random notes about computer skills
* I have been known to learn additional computing languages within a day or less (python, groovy, ruby, etc...), and then promptly forget about them once the task at hand is finished.
* I have experience with a wide variety of tasks related to project management and maintainership. Not the least of which is setting up automation procedures for build servers and website providers.
