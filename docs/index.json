	"content": " Who am I? Ken Moore\n Husband to a wonderful woman Father to some fantastic kids Oh, and a fairly experienced computer software developer.  Basic History  (2006) Took my first computer programming class at university (C++ class - required for physics major). (2007) Learned more practical programming skill at the Air Force Institute of Technology (student internship) (2008) Started graduate work at Ohio UniversityDid extensive numerical modeling work for the next 2-3 years in Fortran while at graduate school (trying to model the collapse of a neutron start into a supernova). (2009) Started working part-time with FreeBSD via the PC-BSD project (testing/fixing application packages called PBI\u0026rsquo;s). (2011) Obtained Master of Science degree in Nuclear Astrophysics from Ohio University (2011) Got hired by iXsystems full-time as part of the PC-BSD project. (Current) Still working for iXsystems as a software engineer and project lead.  Computer Skills    Language Read Write Last Used Notes     C++ Yes Yes Current Primary coding language (with Qt libraries primarily)   Shell Yes Yes Current Use this all the time on FreeBSD and for writing automation procedures   HTML Yes Yes Current Use this off and on to make changes to websites such as this one   C Yes Yes Off and on Most base-level tools in FreeBSD are written in C and need occasional tweaks.   Javascript Yes Somewhat Off and on Even smaller subset of my HTML skill set. Tend to find it unreliable and less precise than languages like C/C++   QML Yes Somewhat 2017 Slight variation of Javascript for embedded Qt applications   Fortran Yes Yes 2011 Mostly numerical calculations and analysis with advanced mathematics.   MATLAB Yes Yes 2008 Wrote graphical atmospheric modeling software in MATLAB    Random notes about computer skills  I have been known to learn additional computing languages within a day or less (python, groovy, ruby, etc\u0026hellip;), and then promptly forget about them once the task at hand is finished. I have experience with a wide variety of tasks related to project management and maintainership. Not the least of which is setting up automation procedures for build servers and website providers.  Projects and Involvement  (2009-2018) TrueOS (formerly known as PC-BSD)  Application testing/fixing (PBI applications) Co-author of EasyPBI with Jesse Smith Author of the PCDM login manager Wrote/fixed various system administration utilities for PC-BSD/FreeBSD  (2012-Current) Lumina Desktop  Creator and lead developer  (2018-Current) Project Trident  Founder and business owner Lead developer and project organizer   Recent Journal Entries "
